# Drone Water Sampling UI Design

## Project Overview
This repository contains the user interface (UI) design for a senior design project focused on water sampling using a drone. The UI is developed using PyQt5 and provides features to support learning modules, live data readings, quizzes, and simulations related to water sampling.

## Features
- **Learning Modules:** Interactive modules to educate users about water sampling and related concepts.
- **Live Data Reading:** Real-time visualization of data collected during water sampling missions.
- **Quiz:** Assessment quizzes to test users' understanding of water sampling and environmental science.
- **Simulation:** Simulation tools to plan and practice water sampling missions.
