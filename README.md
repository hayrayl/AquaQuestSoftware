# Drone Water Sampling UI Design

## Project Overview
This repository contains the user interface (UI) design for a senior design project focused on drone-based water sampling. The UI is developed using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for Qt libraries, which allows for the creation of cross-platform applications with native-looking user interfaces.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified and intuitive design to control the drone and manage water sampling tasks.
- **Real-Time Data Display:** Visualization of real-time data collected by the drone during water sampling missions.
- **Mission Planning:** Tools to plan, execute, and monitor water sampling missions.
- **Settings:** Customizable options for drone and sampling parameters.
