Turbidity
Turbidity measures how clear or cloudy the water is. If the water is cloudy, it means there are lots of tiny particles floating around. These particles can come from dirt, algae, or other things.

Why turbidity?
If water is too cloudy, it can block sunlight that underwater plants need to grow. It helps us know if the water is clean and safe for fish and other animals that live in the pond.

pH
pH tells us how acidic or basic the water is. If the pH is low, the water is acidic, like lemon juice. If the pH is high, the water is basic, like soap. A pH around 7 is neutral, like pure water.

Why Ph?
Fish and plants need the right pH to stay healthy. If the water is too acidic or too basic, it can harm them. Checking the pH helps us keep the pond a safe and happy place for all its creatures.

Temperature
The temperature of the water tells us how warm or cold it is. Just like we like certain temperatures, so do the fish and plants in the pond.

Why temperature?
Some fish like cooler water, while some plants prefer it warmer. Knowing the water temperature helps us understand if the pond is a good environment for its inhabitants.
