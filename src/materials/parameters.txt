pH
pH tells us if water is acidic or basic. A low pH means the water is acidic — sour like a lemon. A high pH means it’s basic — more like baking soda or toothpaste (not exactly something you’d want in your water bottle). A pH around 7 is just right — kind of like calm, peaceful water on a quiet morning at Tippecanoe Lake.

Why Ph?
Fish and plants like things balanced — just like I do when I’m sunbathing on a log. If the pH is too far off, it can hurt my pond friends. That’s why we check it — to keep everyone comfy and healthy!

Temperature
Water temperature tells us how warm or chilly things are. I’ve swum in icy creeks and warm summer ponds across Indiana, and trust me — temperature matters!

Why temperature?
Some fish like it cold and crisp, others like it warm and cozy. If the water’s too hot or cold, it can throw off the whole pond party. That’s why I keep an eye (or a claw) on it.

Turbidity
Turbidity is a fancy word for how clear the water is. If it’s too cloudy, I can’t see my lunch — or the fish can’t see their way home!

Total Dissolved Solids
“TDS” is short for Total Dissolved Solids — it sounds fancy, but it just means all the tiny stuff floating around in the water that you can’t see. That includes things like minerals, salts, and tiny bits from plants or animals.

Why TDS?
If there’s too much stuff in the water, it can cause problems. It might make the water taste weird, hurt plants, or be unsafe for fish — and even for people. I may be tough, but even I don’t want to swim in water that’s overloaded with mystery gunk. Testing TDS helps us know if the water is clean or if it’s got too much going on.

Nitrates/Nitrites
These chemicals can sneak into the water from fertilizers or — yep — poop. When it rains, that stuff can wash off farms or animal areas and slide right into ponds and streams. Gross, right?

Why nitrates/nitrites?
When there’s too much fertilizer or poop in the water, algae go wild and throw an underwater party. But they use up all the oxygen while they party, and that means fish and other creatures (like me!) might not be able to breathe. That’s why we test for nitrates and nitrites — so we can stop the poop-powered algae invasion before it starts.

Heavy Metals
Nope, not guitars and rock concerts — we’re talking about metals like lead, mercury, and chromium. These can end up in the water from pollution or old pipes.

Why heavy metals?
Even small bits of these metals can be dangerous. I may have a strong shell, but heavy metals are no joke. We test the water to make sure nobody — turtle, trout, or human — gets sick.
